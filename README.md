Clustering Mixed Datasets with Homogeneity Analysis
This repository contains the code and data associated with "Clustering Mixed Datasets with Homogeniety Analysis"

The Auto-MPG and Heart Disease R files show how to apply homogeniety analysis with the homals package to learn the euclidean representation of the categorical variables in a mixed dataset. The learned euclidean representation yields very meaningful clusters in both cases.
